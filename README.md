## I have two files app.jsx and apppstate.jsx

Appstate.jsx utilizes useState for component state  and lifecycle
App.jsx which I was experimenting utilizes useReducer for better statemanagement

I would advice you to use the appstate.jsx for rendering while  I still work on the App.jsx
  which is the imported to the main.jsx file by default.

  Thank you
